Lighthouse QSB Plugin
================================================================================

Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a [QSB](http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/) plugin providing access to a [lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com) account.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. quickly create new tickets
 2. search existing tickets

Currently, it does neither of those things. It will allow you to enter your
lighthouse subdomain, and an API token, but it won't do anything with them yet.
