Lighthouse QSB Plugin
================================================================================

The intended uses of this plugin are:
 1. quickly create lighthouse tickets using QSB
 2. search lighthouse tickets using QSB

Currently, it does neither of those things. It will allow you to enter your
lighthouse subdomain, and an API token, but it won't do anything with them yet.
